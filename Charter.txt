Group 3
1. Nights normally work best for me, M/W I finish class at 6:15PM, T/TH I finish at 5:00PM, free Friday-Sunday any time
2. 30 minutes to an hour at in worst possible case. 
3. Task is complete when all group members come to a general agreement that it is done, may require levels of compromise
4. I think 2-3 times a week seems reasonable given that is standard to the typical amount of times you would meet for a class
each week. Perhaps an hour or two per meeting depending on what we are working on? 
5. Overall document that tracks our desired policies from the get go (outline code style, check-insteps, and documentation)
  5a. Second document of proposed policies/styles, etc. If agreed upon by a majority of group members, add them to the official list
6. Assuming we have 3 actions before involving the instructor, we can adopt a sort of "3-strikes" policy
  1. The first time it happens (assuming with valid excuse) we as a group (the person who did not meet expectations obviously included) can make up
  the slack. It isn't the greatest solution, but we all fall short of expectations at least once in a while, so a single pass doesn't seem ridiculous to me.
  We are a team, so we can help eachother out once in a while.
  2. The second time, we can have a group sit-down where we each explain to the person who hasn't met expectations how this is negatively affecting our work
  flow. Often, the pressure of letting down your group mates is a huge motivator.
  3. The third time, we can talk to the scrum master and ask them to have a one on one meeting with the individual
